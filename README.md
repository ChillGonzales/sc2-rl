This repo is meant to be an attempt to implement SC2 reinforcement learning agents using the algorithms developed in OpenAI's baselines repo. 

Note: I am currently working off a forked version of baselines so I can inject some additional tweaks to the algorithms, but this should work just fine using the regular baselines package.
